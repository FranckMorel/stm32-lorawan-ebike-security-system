# STM32 LoRaWAN E-Bike Security System

Smart anti-theft and tracking system for E-Bikes based on STM32, LoRaWAN, GNSS, RFID authentication and MQTT-based monitoring.

---

## Overview

This project implements a smart embedded anti-theft and tracking system for E-Bikes using STM32 and LoRaWAN technology.

The system detects unauthorized movement, authenticates users via RFID, acquires GNSS location data and transmits telemetry over LoRaWAN to The Things Network (TTN).

The firmware is written in C/C++ using a modular and hardware-oriented embedded software architecture.

## Development Tools

- Mbed Studio
- MbedOS
- STM32CubeMX
- Logic Analyzer
- Oscilloscope
- ST-Link Debugger
- KiCad

---

## Future Improvements

- BLE integration for local communication
- Mobile application support
- OTA firmware update support

---

## Electrical Design Notes

- All peripherals operate at 3.3V logic levels
- Shared GND between all modules is required
- I2C lines require pull-up resistors
- SPI traces should remain short for signal integrity
- Decoupling capacitors are recommended near each peripheral

---

## LoRaWAN Stack

The LoRaWAN stack integration is based on the official MbedOS LoRaWAN example application provided by Arm Mbed.

The project extends and adapts the original example implementation with custom application logic, payload handling, sensor integration and state machine for the E-Bike security use case.
